# DGT Centaur mods (Alistair's version)

The [original](https://github.com/EdNekebno/DGTCentaurMods) DGT Centaur mods project adds features to the DGT Centaur electronic chessboard.

Inside the DGT Centaur is a Raspberry Pi Zero with an SD Card, by replacing that with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (or Raspberry Pi Zero W) and using a modified software, we get a wireless enabled chessboard that can theoretically do practically anything we can imagine.

This current project overrides the legacy one, re-coding and re-factoring all the unstable scripts.

**A word of caution!**

**All functionality is based on the fact that the Raspberry Pi Zero inside the board is being replaced with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (or Raspberry Pi Zero W) and this breaks the product warranty. Proceed at your own risk!**

## Current reworked features

Advanced web Interface - on http://IP_ADDRESS or the hostname of you board.

Moves undoing & forcing have been added.

Chess Engines.

New "Famous!" module that allows to train against famous games.
