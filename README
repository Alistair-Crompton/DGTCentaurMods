Code for controlling a DGT Centaur chess board. Implements the reverse engineered protocols for piece detection, lights, sound, and display. Not currently in an actively usable state. Feel free to contribute - the goal is to make a menu giving the board additional features.

To use: root the raspberry pi in your DGT centaur, replace with Raspberry Pi Zero W. Connect Wifi. Place your lichess api key in config.py
